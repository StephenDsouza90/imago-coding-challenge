# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. **Overview**
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this product is to create a backend system that retrieves media content stored in Elasticsearch and serves it to users in a user-friendly way. The system will allow users to search, filter, and retrieve media URLs efficiently.

### 1.2 Scope
- **In Scope**:
  - Backend API for media search and retrieval.
  - Integration with Elasticsearch for data querying.
  - URL generation for media thumbnails.
  - Basic caching using Redis to improve performance.
- **Out of Scope**:
  - Frontend user interface.
  - Advanced analytics or reporting features.

### 1.3 Objectives and Goals
- Provide a robust backend API for media search and retrieval.
- Ensure efficient performance and scalability for large datasets.
- Handle unstructured or missing data gracefully.
- Demonstrate coding skills, thought process, and problem-solving abilities.

## 2. **Functional Requirements**
### 2.1 Core Features
- **In Scope**:
  - **Search Media**: Allow users to search for media content using keywords.
  - **Filter Media**: Enable filtering based on metadata fields like suchtext.
  - **Media URL Generation**: Construct media URLs using the specified format.
  - **Pagination**: Support paginated results for large datasets.
- **Out of Scope**:
  - **Fuzzy Search**: Handle typos and misspellings in user queries.

### 2.2 User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to search for media by keyword so that I can find relevant content quickly.
- **As a user**, I want to filter media results by suchtext so that I can narrow down my search.
- **As a user**, I want to retrieve media URLs so that I can view thumbnails easily.

### 2.3 Data Requirements
- Input: Search keywords, filters (e.g., suchtext).
- Output: Media metadata and constructed URLs.
- Transformations: Normalize data (e.g., handle missing fields).

## 3. **Non-Functional Requirements**
### 3.1 Performance
- API response time should be under 500ms for most queries.
- Use Redis caching to reduce load on Elasticsearch for frequently accessed data.

### 3.2 Scalability
- Support large datasets with efficient Elasticsearch queries and pagination.

### 3.3 Security
- Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

### 3.4 Usability
- Provide clear and descriptive error messages for invalid queries or no results.

## 4. **Technical Requirements**
### 4.1 System Architecture
- The system will consist of a Python-based backend API.
- Elasticsearch will be used for data querying.
- Redis will be used for caching frequently accessed data.
- The application will be containerized using Docker.
- Kubernetes (K8s) / Docker Compose will be used to manage the infrastructure and deployment.

### 4.2 Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: Elasticsearch
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes / Docker Compose

### 4.3 Integration
- Integrate with the provided Elasticsearch server for media data.
- Use Redis for caching search results and frequently accessed data.

## 5. **Assumptions and Constraints**
- The Elasticsearch server is accessible and operational.
- Redis is available for caching.
- The system will only handle backend functionality; no frontend is required.

## 6. **Risks and Mitigation**
- **Risk**: Elasticsearch downtime.
  - **Mitigation**: Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms.
- **Risk**: High latency for large datasets.
  - **Mitigation**: Use Redis caching and optimize Elasticsearch queries.

## 7. **Success Metrics**
- API response time under 500ms for 90% of queries.
- Accurate search results with minimal errors.
- Positive feedback on code quality and structure.
