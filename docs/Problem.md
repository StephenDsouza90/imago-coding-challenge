# Problem Identification

## Problem 1: Unstructured and Overloaded “suchtext” Field

**Problem:**

The `suchtext` field in the Elasticsearch index is a single, unstructured text blob that contains a mixture of keywords, descriptions, locations, event details, and copyright information. This lack of structure results in keyword searches (e.g., “nature”) returning a broad range of results, including unrelated content such as news events, people, and locations, instead of specific content related to natural landscapes.

**Impact:**

This structure reduces the precision and relevance of search results, leading to user frustration and a poor search experience. The inability to target specific fields in search queries limits the effectiveness of keyword-based searches, making it challenging for users to locate the intended type of media content.

**Solution:**

Implement a structured data ingestion process that separates the `suchtext` field into more specific fields, such as `description`, `location`, `event`, `tags`, and `copyright`.

## Problem 2: Redundant or Duplicated Data in “suchtext”

**Problem:**

The `suchtext` field contains repeated information, such as location and copyright data, which may appear multiple times within the same document.

**Impact:**

Redundant data inflates the index size, reduces search efficiency, and increases storage costs. It also degrades search precision, as repeated terms can skew relevance scoring.

**Solution:**

Normalize and deduplicate data during the ingestion process to ensure that each piece of information is only stored once. Implement a data transformation step that consolidates similar data points and removes unnecessary repetitions.

## Problem 3: Missing “language” Field for Multilingual Support

**Problem:**

The Elasticsearch index lacks a dedicated `language` field, making it challenging to search data based on language, especially in a multilingual dataset.

**Impact:**

The absence of a `language` field restricts users from targeting content in specific languages, reducing usability for international audiences and complicating search logic.

**Solution:**

Introduce a `language` field and populate it during data ingestion. Utilize language detection libraries to automatically identify and tag the language of each document.
