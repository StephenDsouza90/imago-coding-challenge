# Handling Large Volumes of Data

To ensure the system can handle large volumes of data and high request rates, the performance and scalability features are:

- **Kubernetes Deployment:** The backend is deployed on Kubernetes with **3 pods** for redundancy and load distribution. This setup can be easily extended to use **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** for dynamic scaling based on demand.
- **Caching with Redis:** Redis is used for caching frequent queries and results, reducing load on Elasticsearch and improving response times.
- **Asynchronous API:** The API is built with **FastAPI** using `async/await` and the asynchronous Elasticsearch client, allowing efficient handling of concurrent requests.
- **Connection Pooling:** The same client instance is reused for both Redis and Elasticsearch throughout the application, ensuring efficient connection pooling and optimal resource usage.
- **Pagination & Filtering:** All endpoints support pagination and filtering to minimize payload sizes and optimize query performance.
- **Resource Limits:** Kubernetes resource limits are set for CPU and memory to ensure fair scheduling and prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Logging & Observability:** Logging is implemented for observability, though full monitoring (e.g., with Prometheus/Grafana) is not yet in place.

This ensures that each request is fast and reduces latency for users as well as ensures the system can efficiently handle increasing loads, more users, and larger datasets by distributing work and resources.
